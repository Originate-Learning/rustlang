Learning Rust
================

## Motivations

Theres not a lot to say that https://www.rust-lang.org/ doesn't cover right on the front page. Highlights 

- zero-cost abstractions
- move semantics
- guaranteed memory safety
- threads without data races
- trait-based generics
- pattern matching
- type inference
- minimal runtime
- efficient C bindings

Additional cool things:

- Built in support for dependency management via [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo), whose packages are hosted on [crates.io](https://crates.io/)

## Resources

[The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) is the standard reference. The Rust community is also a very fantastic resource. It could be argued that there is no more friendly or welcoming community than the Rust community. Check out their IRC channel and subreddit!
